ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AhmedBagy, 


Self-taught developer that dived into tool creation, serving partially as a software developer. I then moved into data analysis, focusing on data management and visualizations. Throughout this journey, I have acquired new skills in SQL, Python, problem-solving, data analysis, data visualization, and built a foundation in machine learning and AI. Being self-taught and driven by business needs, my fast learning pace was triggered and continually refined.

I am proactive, and my master's degree allowed me to polish my mindset and become adept at research, enabling me to digest information more effectively. This ability is crucial in tech, where identifying the problem is the highest challenge, but solutions will eventually be found. I firmly believe that while finding the problem is significant, the varied and adaptable solutions that follow are where true innovation lies.

With my strong background in video editing and a commitment to ongoing learning and development, I am dedicated to helping our team succeed. My diverse skill set allows me to make data-driven decisions and present information in a more impactful way, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in the digital media landscape.
